                    '<p>I used to be a naive child who didn’t understand music at all. Although my father and mother really liked music, I couldn’t comprehend it. My father gave me a keyboard when I was 10 years old and a guitar when I was 13. However, I couldn’t play them for years because I didn’t understand the concepts.</p>',
                    '<p>When I was in the second year of middle school, around 14 years old, my father offered me a saxophone to play. Since then, I felt motivated because the saxophone is an instrument that is rarely used. I was also introduced to a music teacher who made learning very comfortable, Mr. Adit. I studied with Mr. Adit for about two weeks to play my first song on the saxophone, "Indonesia Jaya."</p>',
                    '<p>After that, I began to understand music because I started with the correct theory. I was able to apply my music theory to play other instruments such as guitar, keyboard, flute, drums, harmonica, kendang, and violin. I also started performing regularly with the saxophone at various events, starting with my middle school graduation in 2017, SMP anniversary events, SMA anniversary events, the Luwijawa International Festival, and many others.</p>'

                    '<p>I only began running, exercising, and managing my diet at the age of 16. Before that, when I entered junior high school, I had a huge appetite—I could eat up to six times a day. This habit led me to obesity, with my weight shooting up from 60 kg to 80 kg within just one year, eventually reaching a peak of 89 kg. In high school, I was still overweight during my first year. However, in the second half of that year, I heard about the Paskibraka selection, and that news really motivated me. I responded immediately by starting to run slowly, building up gradually—from 500 meters, then 1 km, then 2 km. I kept it up every single day for a full month without taking a break.</p>',
                    '<p>In addition to running and working out, I also started managing my diet by simply counting the calories of all the food I ate. As a result, I successfully transformed my body—from 86 kg down to 63 kg—in just 1.5 months. Since then, running has become something I can’t live without. I’ve kept up the habit of running every morning. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had more free time, which I used to exercise even more. I ran my first 10 km during that period. I also consistently worked out every night using a pair of 4-kg dumbbells that I bought at a store. I started with basic workout tutorials through a home workout app I downloaded from the Play Store, and from a YouTube channel called Hasfit. Until today, I still try to make time for running or other forms of exercise despite my increasingly busy schedule—even though the intensity isn’t as high as it used to be.</p>'

                text: [
                    '<p>Actually, ever since I was a child—around 5 years old—I already loved going on little adventures in the rice fields near my house. However, my parents were often worried whenever I went outside to explore. Even so, I often found sneaky ways to go out anyway. I would go swimming in the river with friends, wander into the forest, go fishing in the rice fields, hike to Rangkok Hill, visit the Danawarih bridge, and many more places—some of which I still havent confessed to my parents.</p>',
                    '<p>But everything changed when I entered the Geophysical Engineering program, which requires exploring all kinds of terrains. That’s when I made my first negotiation with my parents—to let me go hiking for the first time. The first mountain I climbed was Mount Lawu, which stands at 3,265 meters above sea level. I reached the summit on July 25, 2022. I hiked with some of my classmates: Alina, Gianangel, Ahmad, Fajar, Bayu, Firdos, Bagus, Dimas, and Fandi. As my very first hike, it was a truly valuable experience. I immediately felt like this was one of the happiest things I had ever done in my life—climbing a mountain. A lot happened on that first hike, from our motorbike breaking down on the way, to getting into an argument with Ahmad, and many more unforgettable moments.</p>',
                    '<p>The next mountain was Mount Slamet, with an elevation of 3,429 meters above sea level. I hiked this mountain with just one friend, Yudith. We chose the old hiking route, which was completely deserted the entire way. So throughout the journey, it was just the two of us, surrounded by Mount Slamet and its natural beauty. We moved quickly—starting our hike at 6:00 AM and arriving at the camping post around 4:30 PM. We continued to the summit the next morning, on July 12, 2023. The trail to the summit was the most challenging part, especially since there were no ropes or assistance lines like on other routes. That made the experience all the more memorable for me.</p>',
                    '<p>The third mountain I climbed was Mount Merbabu, which stands at 3,142 meters above sea level. I hiked this one with my classmates: Dina, Alina, Fadeli, Ahmad, Bagus, Dimas, and Alfa. At that time, the mountain was fairly crowded since it was during the school holiday period. Along the way, we saw a variety of landscapes—from dust that stung our eyes to grasslands that were a feast for the eyes. In the middle of the hike, we even passed by Wendy (an Indonesian celebrity), but we were too tired to notice at the time. On this hike, I also carried a double carrier to help one of my female friends who was struggling. We reached the triangulation summit on July 25, 2023.</p>',
                    '<p>The fourth mountain I climbed was Mount Sumbing, which has an elevation of 3,371 meters above sea level. I hiked it with just one friend, Fadeli. It was a rather spontaneous trip that we planned on short notice. But during the hike, I realized that Mount Sumbing was the most beautiful mountain I had ever climbed so far. We moved at a good pace, starting at 5:30 AM and arriving at the campsite by 4:00 PM. Since we felt we had enough energy, we decided to continue to the Sejati Summit of Sumbing the same day—August 16, 2023. The next morning, we packed up and descended, arriving at the base camp by 10:00 AM.</p>',
                    '<p>The fifth mountain I climbed was Mount Sindoro, which stands at 3,153 meters above sea level. I hiked this one with Fadel, who brought two of his friends from Sumatra—Heru and Esta. We planned to do a one-day hike (a "tektok" hike). We started at 4:00 AM and reached the summit around 1:00 PM on October 19, 2023. After that, we immediately descended and got back to the base camp around 5:00 PM. It was my first tektok hike, and it left a strong impression—it was a great way to train speed and precision, especially since we didn’t bring any tents.</p>',

                    '<p>Ive loved animals since I was a child, a passion that also came from frequently going on little adventures around my neighborhood. I was often taken fishing by Mr. Muin since I was about five years old, and that really awakened my adventurous spirit. Almost every week, I would go out to catch fish and then keep them in a well until they grew bigger. Besides fish, when I was seven years old, I once caught a small snake and put it in an aquarium. But once my parents found out, I got in huge trouble and was scolded badly.</p>',
                    '<p>Still, I was never discouraged. If snakes weren’t allowed, I moved on to catching lizards, which I kept in a cage I made myself. I even once bought a monitor lizard online (Varanus nebulosus), but since I didn’t have a proper enclosure, I secretly kept it in the storage room without my parents knowing. I also bought a reticulated python and did the same—hid it in the storage room. Apart from fish and reptiles, I’ve always loved cats. I’ve had many cats growing up, but one of the longest-living and dearest to me is a cat named “Comel,” which I got from my mom’s coworker in 2019. She has a flat nose and a chubby body, and she made me love staying at home. Besides Comel, we’ve adopted many other cats into our household over the years.</p>',
                    '<p>At one point, I also got into birds. Ever since I was little, I had always wanted a Dollarbird (Burung Tengkek). Even though I’ve had a few, I could never manage to take proper care of them. I also once had an owl that lived quite a long time—I named him “Doni”—but sadly, he passed away. To this day, I still love watching, handling, and taking care of animals. I always feel so happy whenever I visit a zoo. I still buy fish even though they often don’t survive long. I’ve kept Flowerhorns, various Channa, predatory fish, many types of koi, river fish, and many other species.</p>',

For me, films can be windows into different perspectives of life, ways to understand human behavior, and powerful tools to evoke empathy and social awareness. Sometimes, a single scene can leave me thinking for days.</p>',
                    '<p>Because of this passion, I once tried making my own short film. At that time, I wanted to express a simple idea about someone caught between reality and hope. I wrote the script and worked on the project with a few friends, and we uploaded the result to my YouTube channel. The outcome? Honestly, it was still very messy. But it was through that process that I learned so much—from the importance of strong storytelling, proper cinematography, to how to manage the rhythm and pacing of each scene.</p>',
